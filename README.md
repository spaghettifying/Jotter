# Jotter
 A simple text editor

 The base of this project followed along the tutorial [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) by SnapToken

 However, I will be adding extra functionality to it such as storing the editor configs in separate files, adding more syntax highlighting, auto indent, etc.
